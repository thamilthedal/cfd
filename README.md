> Modules that I built or under building stage to help with the workflow for my research.

I use,
- ANSYS Fluent for my numerical simulations
- Meshing done both in ANSYS Meshing and BlockMeshDict from OpenFoam package.
- Post-processing primarily in CFD-Post and then publishing them through Python plots and Latex.
